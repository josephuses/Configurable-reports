## Introduction

The database management system of the Knowledge Hub (or KHub), Philippine Science High School's implementation of MOODLE, is PostgreSQL.  These SQL statements were adapted in part or fully from https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/ad-hoc_contributed_reports

## How to use these configurable reports?

The [configurable_reports](https://docs.moodle.org/310/en/Configurable_reports) plugin has to be installed first.  If not, ask your administrator to install it.  Then create SQL reports and adapt these SQL statements to your use case.
